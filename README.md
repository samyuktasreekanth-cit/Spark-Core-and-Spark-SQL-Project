# Spark-Core-and-Spark-SQL-Project

This is part of the Big Data Processing Module as part of the Masters in Artificial Intelligence Project

this project involves the exploration of Spark Core and Spark SQL in analysing large datasets. 

OptimiseYourJourney, which will enter the market next year with a clear goal in mind: “leverage Big Data technologies for improving the user experience in transportation”.                  

Dataset: csv. Each row of a file contains the following fields:  Date , Bus_Line , Bus_Line_Pattern , Congestion , Longitude , Latitude , Delay , Vehicle , Closer_Stop , At_Stop
Technologies and tools used: Python, pyspark, Spark SQL, Spark Core, Google Colab

The following exercises are placed in the folder my_code: 
1. A01_ex1_spark_core.py   
2. A01_ex1_spark_sql.py       
3. A01_ex2_spark_core.py    
4. A01_ex2_spark_sql.py       
5. A01_ex3_spark_core.py
